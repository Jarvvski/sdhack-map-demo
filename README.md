# sdhack-map-demo

 Sponsered by ShopDirect and IBM, this hackathon was all about how to inovate for customers. Our team focussed on the idea of delivery tracking and push notifications.
 
 My role on the team was to intergrate a mapping solution for us to simulate tracking a delivery for the hackathon.
